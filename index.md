Hi y'all! I'am Alex Yang, and this is my new personal website. I'll get the construction done this summer. For quick info of me, I am an in-coming PhD student in Georgia Tech in CSE-Bio program, and will potentially work with Hannah Choi doing some computational neuroscience stuff. Before that, I somehow got an M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics in Columbia, U.S., and a B.S. degree in Chemistry (what?) in Wuhan University, China. 

My current research interest lies in RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), no, not the RNNs in computer science like LSTM, but a simpler one with amazing ability to do cognitive tasks. So it's still neuroscience with more abstraction, and kinda like open the black box task. Before that I mainly do neuroscience models from *the first principle*, e.g. visual system of fruit flies, some mean-filed kinetic PDEs of balanced IF network. Then I feel spiking network is somehow dumb and cursed, so I feel I'll be doomed if I stick on that, that's the reason I switch to RNNs.

- I'm going to Gatech!!! actually get a mixed feeling on this... :|
- Back from Maxico, I love the vibe of Mexico City~

For more fun, make sure to check my blogs! Enjoy!
