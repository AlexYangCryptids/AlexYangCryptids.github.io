Hi y'all! I'm Alex Yang Wang. I'm currently a PhD student in the CSE-Bio program at Georgia Tech, and work with [Hannah Choi](https://hannahchoi.math.gatech.edu) doing **computational neuroscience**. Before that, I somehow got an M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, U.S., and an Honor B.S. degree in Chemistry (what?) at Wuhan University, China. 

My current research is mainly around **neural representation and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, especially around low-dimensional & low-rank neural representation in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and real neural data. They are somewhat abstract and machine-learning-like, but now I think this could be the right path. Besides that, I'm also fascinated by biophysical neurons and the chaos theory in random RNNs (call me an amatuer physicist lol). 

Besides research, I love coffee, puzzle solving, reading and water sports. I'm a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) and Splatoon (I main Dualie Squelchers, but only S rank, cuz Splatoon 3 sucks and I play it less and less). My go-to coffee is always black sesame latte. I'm a rat & dog lover. Finally, I love cryptids, conspiracies and all kinds of wierd mysticism stuff (unfortunately I don't believe in them). My current favoraite TV show is *Resident Alien*. 



## News

- I'm going to GaTech!!! actually get a mixed feeling on this...
- Graduate from Columbia! Also flied back from Maxico, I love the vibe of Mexico City
