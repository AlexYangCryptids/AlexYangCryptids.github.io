Hi y'all! I'm Alex Yang Wang. I'm currently a PhD student in the CSE-Bio program of Georgia Tech, and work with [Hannah Choi](https://hannahchoi.math.gatech.edu) doing computational neuroscience. Before that, I somehow got an M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, U.S., and a B.S. degree in Chemistry (what?) at Wuhan University, China. 

My current research interest lies in neural representations, prediction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). They are somewhat abstract and machine-learning-like, but now I think this could be the right path. Besides that, I'm also fascinated by the biophysical neurons and endeavoring to comprehend the extent to which their complexity can be reduced (real neurons are pretty, eh, messy). 

Before I join GaTech, I mainly did neural models from *the first principle*, e.g. visual system of fruit flies, some mean-field kinetic PDEs of balanced IF network, and auto-encoder with synaptic plasitcity (the last one is ML though). They still sound cool to me but the first principle just cannot tell you everything. 

Besides research, I love reading, water sports, gaming and writing. I plan to develop my own 2d game, so now I am basically learning Unity. I also tried to learn Spanish, but got lazy anyway...

And finally, I **love** cryptids, urban myths and all the wierd stuff (no I DO NOT believe any of these, but they are insanely fun aren't they?). By the way, my favorite cryptid is the Mokele-mbembe (still living dinosaurs in the Congo jungle!). 



## News

- I'm going to Gatech!!! actually get a mixed feeling on this...
- Back from Maxico, I love the vibe of Mexico City~

For more fun, make sure to check my blogs! Enjoy!
