Hi y'all! I'm Alex Yang Wang. I'm currently a PhD student in the CSE-Bio program at Georgia Tech, and work with [Hannah Choi](https://hannahchoi.math.gatech.edu) doing **computational neuroscience**. Before that, I somehow got an M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, U.S., and an Honor B.S. degree in Chemistry (what?) at Wuhan University, China. 

My current research is mainly around **neural representation, neural coding and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**. They are somewhat abstract and machine-learning-like, but now I think this could be the right path. Besides that, I'm also fascinated by the biophysical neurons (do we miss anything when using simplified models like IF? can we do more with the first principle?). 

Besides research, I love coffee, puzzle solving, reading and water sports. I'm a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) and Splatoon (I main Dualie Squelchers, but only S rank). My go-to coffee is always black sesame latte. I'm a rat & dog lover. Finally, I love cryptids, conspiracies and all kinds of wierd mysticism stuff (unfortunately I don't believe in them).
